# Changes to the SimFin Python package

## Version 0.8.2 (2021-09-13)

Added financial signals support for banks and insurance datasets.


## Version 0.8.0 (2020-07-08)

Public beta version.

### Changes

-   Added 2 new datasets, 'derived' and 'derived-shareprices'. For more details about the datasets visit: https://simfin.com/data/bulk


## Version 0.7.0 (2020-06-04)

Public beta version.

### Changes

-   Added column `RESTATED_DATE` to financial reports and clarified the
    definition of `REPORT_DATE` and `PUBLISH_DATE`. Also updated Tutorial 01.

-   Removed package `pyarrow` from `setup.py` because it is a large download
    and it is only used in `cache.py` if the user explicitly wants it. So now
    the user has to manually install this package if they want to use it.


## Version 0.6.0 (2020-04-12)

Public beta version.

This version is all about signals: https://youtu.be/u15BUoioCZw

### Changes

-   Added signals: `PCASH`, `PAYOUT_RATIO`, `BUYBACK_RATIO`,
    `PAYOUT_BUYBACK_RATIO`, `RD_REVENUE`, `RD_GROSS_PROFIT`, `RORC`,
    `ACQ_ASSETS_RATIO`, `INVENTORY_TURNOVER`, `QUICK_RATIO`, `LOG_REVENUE`,
    `CAPEX_DEPR_RATIO`

-   Added functions `sf.rel_change_ttm_1y` and `sf.rel_change_ttm_2y`
    e.g. for use in signal-calculations.

-   Added unit-test for `signals.py`


## Version 0.5.0 (2020-03-14)

Public beta version.

This new version may help clean your bank-account from the bird-flu virus:

### Changes

-   Extended function `sf.clip()` with argument `clip`. 

-   Changed calculation of signals: ROA, ROE, ASSET_TURNOVER.

-   Made function `sf.convert_to_periods()` public.

-   Added function `sf.moving_zscore()`

-   Added function `sf.shares()` and its use in various other functions.

-   Added argument `exclude_columns` and support for Pandas Series to function
    `sf.winsorize()`

-   Added signals for `ASSETS_GROWTH` and changed the syntax for the function
    `sf.growth_signals()` and updated the `StockHub` to support this.

-   Added data quality tests to `test_bulk_data.ipynb`

-   Added various signals.


## Version 0.4.0 (2020-01-25)

Public beta version.

Please be patient if you experience any problems. Although the system may look
fully automated, there is actually a little man sitting inside the server to
handle all of your requests: https://youtu.be/8cXF88XzALk

### Changes

-   Added function `sf.max_drawdown()`

-   Added documentation using the sphinx system and setup automatic generation
    of the docs at: https://simfin.readthedocs.io/
    
-   Setup automatic daily testing using GitHub Actions for both the simfin
    package and the tutorials.


## Version 0.3.0 (2020-01-03)

Early public beta version.

In this version, we were mainly trying to decide which colour the icons
should be: https://youtu.be/UMXs9i201AQ

### Changes

-   Added `sf.StockHub` for easy loading and processing of stock data,
    and wrote a new tutorial on this.

-   Added function `sf.rel_change()` for calculating stock returns and
    various growth-rates. Added `sf.mean_log_change()` for calculating
    mean-log stock returns e.g. for all 1-3 year periods. Also wrote a
    new tutorial for these functions.

-   Added function `sf.apply()` for applying a function to a DataFrame
    with either a single or multiple stocks. Changed `sf.asfreq()`,
    `sf.resample()`, `sf.reindex()`, and `sf.rel_change()` to use this.
    Added a section to Tutorial 01 on this.

-   Added several functions for calculating signals from financial data,
    and wrote a new tutorial for these functions.
    
-   Added wrapper-function ` @sf.cache` for caching the result of slow
    functions to disk. Added its use in all signal-functions. Wrote
    Tutorial 06 on this.
    
-   Extended bulk-data system to support json-files with meta-info.
    Added functions `sf.load_info_datasets` and `sf.load_info_columns`
    and used them in `datasets.py` and `test_bulk_data.py`. Also added
    functions `sf.info_datasets` and `sf.info_columns` and used them
    in Tutorial 01.


## Version 0.2.0 (2019-11-09)

"Private" beta version only intended for a small number of friends and
experienced users of SimFin.

It took us a while to make these changes, because we consider our moves
very carefully: https://youtu.be/HxWCAJS7Co8

### Changes

-   Added bulk-data load-functions for banks and insurance companies.
-   Changed all specialized bulk-data load-functions to use functools.partial.
-   Added 'full' variants for datasets: income, balance, cashflow.
    The 'full' variant has more columns than the 'free' variant.
-   Added 'shareprices-latest' dataset variant.
-   Added support for dataset markets e.g. `sf.load_income(variant='annual', market='us')`
-   Added a script that generates 'names.py' from the SimFin-server's database.
-   Improved implementation of `sf.resample()` and also added the functions
    `sf.reindex()` and `sf.asfreq()`. Also wrote a new tutorial for these.


## Version 0.1.0 (2019-09-26)

Alpha version only intended for developers.
